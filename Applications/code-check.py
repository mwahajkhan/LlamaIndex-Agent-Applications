        - "correct": Y/N (Y if the code is correct, N if the code is incorrect)
        - "feedback": Feedback on the code. This should be a string. If the code is correct, the feedback should be "The code is correct". If the code is incorrect, the feedback should be a string explaining why the code is incorrect.
