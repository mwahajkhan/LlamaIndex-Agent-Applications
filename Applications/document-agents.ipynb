A \\nmajority of adolescents report that social media helps them feel more accepted (58%), like they have people who can support them through tough times (67%), like they have a place to show their creative side (71%), and more connected to what’s going on in their friends’ lives (80%).

The definition of social media has been highly debated \\nover the past few decades. As a result, there isn’t a single, widely‑accepted scholarly definition of social media. (Aichner et al., 2021) The definition may vary from the cited research in this document based on the methods used in each study. In making conclusions and recommendations, this document regards social media as “internet‑based channels that allow users to opportunistically interact and selectively self‑present, either in real‑time or asynchronously, with both broad and narrow audiences who derive value from user‑generated content and the perception of interaction with others.” (Carr & Hayes, 2015) For the purposes of this product, we did not include studies specific to online gaming or e‑sports.

It is diagnosed \\naccording to standardised criteria. The \\nterm mental disorder  is also used to \\nrefer to these health problems. \\nA mental health problem also \\ninterferes with how a person thinks, \\nfeels, and behaves, but to a lesser \\nextent than a mental illness. \\nMental health problems are more \\ncommon and include the mental \\nill health that can be experienced \\ntemporarily as a reaction to the \\nstresses of life. \\nMental health problems are less \\nsevere than mental illnesses, but may \\ndevelop into a mental illness if they \\nare not effectively dealt with. Mental illnesses cause a great deal of \\nsuffering to those experiencing them, \\nas well as their families and friends. \\nFurthermore, these problems appear to \\nbe increasing. According to the World \\nHealth Organization, depression will \\nbe one of the biggest health problems \\nworldwide by the year 2020. \\nTypes of mental illness\\nMental illnesses are of different types \\nand degrees of severity. Some of the \\nmajor types are depression, anxiety, \\nschizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder, \\npersonality disorders, and eating \\ndisorders.\\nThe most common mental illnesses \\nare anxiety and depressive disorders. \\nWhile everyone experiences strong \\nfeelings of tension, fear, or sadness at \\ntimes, a mental illness is present when \\nthese feelings become so disturbing \\nand overwhelming that people have \\ngreat difficulty coping with day-to-day \\nactivities, such as work, enjoying leisure \\ntime, and maintaining relationships. \\nAt their most extreme, people with \\na depressive disorder may not be \\nable to get out of bed or care for \\nthemselves physically. People with \\ncertain types of anxiety disorder may \\nnot be able to leave the house, or may \\nhave compulsive rituals to help them \\nalleviate their fears.\\nWhat is mental \\nillness?', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2270, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8620395947647845), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='8c06a0b0-5452-4e93-bd58-cf8afb592d67', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 228227, 'creation_date': '2024-07-21', 'last_modified_date': '2020-01-15'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7445ff4f-1bca-48b0-a2a8-4370dc4e6d7b', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 228227, 'creation_date': '2024-07-21', 'last_modified_date': '2020-01-15'}, hash='9608e369b887ce92801abd5ee14875fcaad5964e2dfd9f4d82c4e99ed20da33c')}, text='What is \\nmental illness ?', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=25, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8506177359263427), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='7016d562-bda3-4c9e-a5d0-a8b942f17413', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 228227, 'creation_date': '2024-07-21', 'last_modified_date': '2020-01-15'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='8397b408-a03f-406c-87d2-212b0a4587e5', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/what_is_mental_illness.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 228227, 'creation_date': '2024-07-21', 'last_modified_date': '2020-01-15'}, hash='0549e56a970e774e7c76ac2a79fcb1fd0603c39a5b2a35a2f1ce3e499cb66029')}, text='history. \\nMany factors contribute to the onset \\nof a mental illness.
